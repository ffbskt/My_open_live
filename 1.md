#Concept
We try to detect all information about state of enviroment (my life) and our agents action (me) to apply RL algorithms later for life advise. I expect that with a large number of people (who share data too) will be able to achieve the highest level of synchronization.

We take many data from archives (not online yet), include my own Google data. (**see image ). Each source of data (archive folder - Keep, Fit, Maps, Telegram messages)  of other people it is current state of the environment "Space" each source (folder)  it is two demention one is coordinate "id" (??how it mesure?? ) and one is time (date). Our action named "body" which put as to next enviroment state with same cordinate (id) but different time. So All files we parse to dictionary {"source":wich archive (space), "user_id": id (coordinate), "date":time, "body":message(action)} (?? body could be coordinate ??)
